Testing

Assignment Instructions:

2. Create a sample test using MonkeyRunner
3. Create a sample test for a bound service
4. Create a sample test using Roboelectic

Note: I added a monkeyrunner.py file to the repository, which is what I found in all examples online... wasn't sure if there was also any android code for this, or how to test it
